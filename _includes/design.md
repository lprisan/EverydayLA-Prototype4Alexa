## Plan/Activities

Planned time: 90-120 mins

### 2. Student presentation rounds **[20' each]**
* Student presents main ideas of their proposal (in less than 15 mins)
* After the presentation, **presenting student** answers [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeBCqldZH0Hsm_C8vsOisFjsoxwmD-KdT8tENaAjoJu250hLQ/viewform){:target="_blank"}
* After the presentation, **audience** answers [this other form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfibHzH__Y231g1M5UDwbd3jqaot8r7boHd05MPUsk_S7rO_g/viewform){:target="_blank"}
* Finally, the student goes to [his/her dashboard](https://luispprieto.shinyapps.io/dashboard4alexa/#section-student){:target="_blank"}, looks at the questions available, and picks the most important ones. Meanwhile, the next student sets up for presenting.

### 3. Breakout groups **[25']**
* Audience breaks out into small groups around each of the presenting students
* Small groups do as many iterations as possible of:
    1. The student picks up an important question from [his/her dashboard](https://luispprieto.shinyapps.io/dashboard4alexa/#section-student){:target="_blank"} (own or posed by audience), and poses it to the small group
    2. The small group responds or gives any other input. The student takes notes of the responses/ideas/conclusions, and next actions in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiui6VocqiWJT8YP6P4JzTFbcjzdX3HrVOcolYu3aiNkQEaw/viewform){:target="_blank"}
    3. When there are no more ideas, or the student feels another question should be posed, go back to 1.

### 4. Wrap-up **[10']**
* The session chair opens up [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhuml-t_adSoo-V-tKLipldSURt6tNie-CV9ylk0vjwXkcqg/viewform){:target="_blank"}, to take notes of the session conclusions
* Each presenting student summarizes in **1 minute** the most interesting thing they've learned in the session
* The floor is opened to the audience to note (briefly!) other interesting lessons learned in the session
* The session chair opens up the [session dashboard](https://luispprieto.shinyapps.io/dashboard4alexa/#section-overall){:target="_blank"}, and shows it to the participants

* Give feedback about the lesson experience in the [http://prolearning.realto.ch](Prolearning) tool
